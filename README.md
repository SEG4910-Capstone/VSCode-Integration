### Using VSCode to develop within containers
Instead of terminals, you can use vscode for easier development experience. This can be easily achieved by using Dev Containers

Once you install this extension, open up the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P **Windows**, Shift + Command + P **Mac**) then search for _attach to running container_ and run that command. It will show you the running containers on your system and you'll be able to attach to it. For the folder for development, you can use /root and make a directory called _ros-workspace_
